# Opsec Render Engine
## Overview
Opsec is an ambitious and cutting-edge project aimed at developing a powerful 3D and VFX rendering engine. The goal is to create an engine that leverages advanced rendering techniques to deliver stunning visual effects and realistic 3D graphics.

## Key Features
1. Advanced Ray Tracing: Our engine will utilize sophisticated ray tracing algorithms to produce highly realistic lighting, shadowing, and reflection effects.
2. Photon Mapping: We plan to implement photon mapping to accurately simulate global illumination and caustics, enhancing the realism of rendered scenes.
3. Scanline Rendering: Efficient scanline algorithms will be employed to handle complex scenes with high performance.
4. Realistic Lighting: The engine aims to simulate realistic lighting scenarios similar to Blender's Eevee engine, providing dynamic and lifelike visuals.
5. Hardware Acceleration: Designed to leverage modern hardware capabilities, optimizing rendering performance and efficiency.
6. Modular Architecture: Built with a modular architecture that allows easy integration of new features and enhancements.
## Project Vision
Opsec is envisioned to become a versatile and powerful rendering engine suitable for a wide range of applications, from cinematic visual effects to real-time 3D graphics. Our long-term goals include:

1. High Performance: Continually optimizing algorithms and leveraging the latest hardware advancements to ensure fast and efficient rendering.
2. User-Friendly Interface: Developing intuitive tools and interfaces to make advanced rendering techniques accessible to artists and developers of all skill levels.
3. Community-Driven Development: Encouraging collaboration and contributions from the community to drive innovation and improve the engine.
4. Open Source: Keeping the core of Opsec open source to foster transparency, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
5. Free: Free to use.
